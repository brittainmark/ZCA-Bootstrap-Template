<h2>Product descriptions</h2>
<p>We do our best to be as accurate as possible when we describe an item
	for sale. All photographs displayed for an item are of that specific
	item, unless otherwise stated. We try and ensure the pictures truly
	depict the item, although due to the variations within natural stones
	and in how different devices display colour tones, the item you receive
	may look slightly different from the image(s) displayed. Measurements
	and weights are approximate, and only intended as a guide.</p>
<h2>Taxes / Import duties</h2>
<h3>UK CUSTOMERS only:</h3>
<p>As we qualify as a small business, we do not reach the VAT threshold
	and therefore you will not have to pay VAT on your purchases.</p>
<h3>CUSTOMERS WITH DELIVERY ADDRESSES IN THE EU:</h3>
<p>With effect from 1st July 2021 ALL businesses are required to charge
	VAT (or its equivalent) on invoices of &euro;150 or less. As a small
	business we cannot afford the costs involved in collecting and
	accounting for this, and so it is with regret that a minimum purchase
	requirement of &pound;150 sterling<sup>*</sup> is now applied to all orders with
	delivery addresses in the EU. Please be aware that the recipient
	is responsible for settlement of any import duties/local taxes due
	on orders fulfilled in excess of this amount, in accordance with
	the taxation and import regulations of the country of delivery.</p>
<p>
	<sup>*</sup>&pound;150 per order, exclusive of postage and packing.
</p>
<h3>ALL OTHER NON-UK CUSTOMERS:</h3>
<p>Please be aware that you will be responsible for settlement of any
	import duties/local taxes that might be due upon delivery of your order
	in accordance with the taxation and import regulations of the country
	of delivery.</p>
