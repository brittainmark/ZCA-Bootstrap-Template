	<strong>What is PayPal and how does it work?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	PayPal is a safer, simpler way to send and receive money online. It's
	free to sign up for a PayPal account, and you can pay for purchases
	either with money held in your PayPal account balance, or by credit
	card, debit card or bank transfer. You can then simply select PayPal as
	your payment method when you shop online, and then log in to your
	account with your email address and password to confirm the payment.
	PayPal never shares your financial information with sellers or
	retailers: for more information visit <a href="http://www.paypal.co.uk"
		target="blank">www.paypal.co.uk.</a><br> <a

<p id="Shop">
	<strong>Do you have a shop? or can we visit you?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We operate our business directly from our home address and do not have
	a high-street outlet whereby you can simply &quot;drop in&quot;.
	However we are always happy to accommodate those who wish to browse and
	buy in person, but need to arrange any such visits to fit in with our
	teaching and therapy commitments. If you would like to call and browse
	through our VERY extensive stock and select crystals for yourself,
	please telephone us (01239) 682676 to arrange a visit. NB: you will
	reach our &quot;Phone Guardian&quot; that will ask you to state your
	name before you are put through.<br> Payment at the time of your visit
	can be arranged by credit / debit card IF you have a PayPal account OR
	by cash.<br> One of the advantages of visiting us is that you can take
	advantage of our expertise (we teach Crystal Healing practitioner
	courses and Crystal workshops and are also qualified Crystal Healers
	and Energy Workers) and discuss with us, if need be, what might be
	right for your needs. You may even be offered a cup of tea! Another
	advantage of a personal shopping visit is that you will not have to pay
	any delivery costs, and you may even be able to negotiate a one-off
	special deal on &quot;large&quot; purchases.<br> Please note that all
	goods sold in this way will be &quot;as seen&quot;, and thus refunds
	(if you later change your mind) will not be possible.<br> <a

<p id="Gift">
	<strong>Can I buy an item as a gift for someone else?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	YES! When completing your order form you are asked if the delivery
	address is other than your own. The item(s) will then be despatched to
	that address, once all other criteria have been satisfied. If you wish
	a message for the recipient (such as: &quot;Happy Birthday Frank, with
	love from Jane&quot;) to be included with the item(s), simply enter it
	in the box that is headed: &quot;delivery message; special
	instructions; comments about your order&quot;.<br> We also can provide
	credit notes / gift vouchers if you wish to give a special gift, yet
	allow the recipient to make their own selections. Eventually you will
	be able to buy these &quot;on-line&quot;, but at the moment if you wish
	to arrange to buy one of these please contact us to discuss what you
	need.<br> <a

<p id="Source">
	<strong>How do you source your stock?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We purchase direct from wholesalers and private suppliers within the
	UK, and in most cases buy items we can hand-pick in person, ensuring
	the quality and integrity of what we offer to others. Wherever possible
	we select crystals from the most ethical and knowledgeable suppliers,
	whilst also choosing them through our experience of quality and price.
	Most of the wholesalers we use specialise in certain crystals and / or
	source them from specific countries, buying direct from the mines or
	their immediate distributors. This means that we are able to acquire
	the best crystals we can find and sell them to our customers, usually
	at &quot;below high street&quot; prices.<br> <a

<p id="Refund">
	<strong>Refunds - changed your mind?</strong>
<p>We make every effort to be honest when describing and photographing
	each item for sale. However there may be circumstances where you are
	not happy with an item you have purchased and wish to return it to us.
	In these cases:
<ul>
	<li>please notify us immediately of your intentions, stating clearly
		the reason for its return</li>
	<li>return the item to us within 28 days of the purchase date, making
		every effort to ensure it reaches us safely and in the same condition
		in which it reached you. You will be responsible for all postage and
		packing costs for the item's safe return to us: &quot;Inner Light
		Crystals&quot; will not accept any &quot;delivery unpaid&quot; items.</li>
</ul>
Once we have received the item and checked its condition is unchanged we
will arrange for a refund of the item's purchase price plus our (outward
bound) standard (lowest) postal cost for that item and the original
packing fee of &pound;1. If you chose a more expensive delivery rate
(e.g. next day delivery) when purchasing the item we regret that these
additional postal costs will not be refunded.

	obviously been damaged in the delivery process, please contact us
	immediately, stating the problem, before you send the item(s) back. We

		outward AND inward bound delivery costs: these will be deducted from
		the invoiced sum, and you will be refunded the difference (assuming
		the item(s) are returned to us in the same condition in which they
		were despatched).
	</li>
	<li>Items returned as 'undeliverable':<br> Please check the delivery
		address is correct before placing an order to avoid items being
